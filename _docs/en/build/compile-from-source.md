## Compilation

Firstly, make sure:
- `maven` has been installed correctly and added to `PATH`
- `devtoolset-7` has been added to `PATH`
- `JAVA_HOME` has been set correctly

Please refer to [Downloads](/docs/downloads) to fetch the sourcesã€‚

```bash
./run.sh build -c
```

The output of compilation will be placed under `DSN_ROOT` of the source directory. It includes `bin`, `include` and `lib`.

## Packaging

Package server binaries for deployment:

```bash
./run.sh pack_server
```

Package client libraries for C/C++ development:

```bash
./run.sh pack_client
```

Package toolset which includes various tools (shell, bench):

```bash
./run.sh pack_tools
```

If this is your first time compiling Pegasus, it's recommended to try [onebox](/overview/onebox).
